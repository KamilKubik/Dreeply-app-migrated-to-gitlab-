THE DREEPLY APP WAS MIGRATED TO GITLAB: ❗️❗️❗️
https://gitlab.com/kamilkubik1/saas-app


Hello! 👋

I am very happy to introduce my new project to the GL community. Besides being happy, I am also very excited. Working on your own application is very absorbing but it also brings a lot of positive emotions, which is the best motivator and simply makes the life of an entrepreneur happier. ✨
The main idea of the dreeply application was to enable people who have no previous business experience or knowledge to create a professional business plan. In addition, I decided to implement more sections for business analysis:

🌱 Startup idea plan
🚀 Business plan creator
💰 Cash flow analysis
🎯 Competitor analysis

I also wanted to maintain all the functionality of the dreeply app, so I decided to switch it off on mobile devices.

I am are open to any feedback but above all, I am happy for the opportunity to introduce you to the dreeply application!

Feel free to use any of the functionalities. 🎉
